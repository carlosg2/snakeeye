SnakeEye is a motion detection application.  Using your webcam, it monitors the amount of motion it sees, and can alert you when something changes. For instance, if someone walks up behind you, or a car pulls into your driveway.

SnakeEye allows you to set the activity threshold depending on what you want to monitor.  Once the threshold is set, just minimize the application, and it will restore itself when enough motion is detected.

SnakeEye is written for AIR, so it's cross-platform and will work with almost any USB, Firewire, or integrated webcam.
